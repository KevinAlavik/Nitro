# Nitro
A kernel using the limine bootloader

Nitro comes with NitroOS and nsh (Nitro Shell). Nitro is a more serious kernel built with some features from [POS](https://github.com/kevinalavik/POS)

## The idea..
I want to make a easy to use and easy to learn OS (built using the kernel) that you can do simple things in like: Programs, Text editing, Graphics, Shell, User accounts, File system shit
